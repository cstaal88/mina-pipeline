Renee Good, the 37-year-old woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month, was reportedly part of one such group.On a recent ride-along with ICE in Minneapolis, The Daily Wire observed dozens of ICE watch protesters tracking federal agents&#8217; every move and showing up to alert illegal immigrants in neighborhoods across the Twin Cities.Assaults on ICE officers have surged more than 1,000% since President Donald Trump returned to office, and death threats have increased by a whopping 8,000%.If individuals attempt to impede arrests, ICE has the authority to arrest the protesters, Samuel Olsen, the director of the agency’s St. Paul office, told The Daily Wire.Radical ICE Watch groups in Minnesota are now openly instructing “white folks” to break detainees out of cop cars pic.twitter.com/z5QZvQZKVq— Jennie Taer (@JennieSTaer) January 21, 2026Before, “it was very rare … now, we’re making arrests of agitators daily,” Olsen said.“When we have to arrest a U.S. citizen, it really takes us away from our other mission.”&#8220;ICE out of Twin Ports&#8221; advertised plans to hold protests in Duluth, Minnesota, on Thursday and Friday as they call out both the local police department and ICE for working together to carry out &#8220;state terror.&#8221; Friday&#8217;s protest is expected to be a &#8220;sit-in&#8221; at the Duluth City Hall.The police chief in Duluth, Mike Ceynowa, however, maintains that the department doesn&#8217;t collaborate with ICE on immigration-related enforcement, but may respond to a scene involving such an arrest to keep things at bay. Ceynowa also said that local officers regularly work with Homeland Security Investigations agents on drug and child sex crimes cases.&#8220;We have a policy regarding immigration enforcement&#8230; We do not do immigration enforcement. It is not something that we are a part of. It also says though, that should the need arise, we may be called upon to peacekeep or de-escalate a situation regarding immigration. We are not going to ask somebody for their papers,&#8221; Ceynowa recently told WDIO News.", "publish_date": "2026-01-21", "url": "https://www.dailywire.com/news/radical-minnesota-ice-watch-groups-instruct-white-folks-to-break-black-detainees-out-of-cop-cars", "my_topic": "minneapolis-ice"}

{"media_url": "dailywire.com", "title": "Minneapolis Prosecutor’s Top Aide Was Part Of Anti-ICE Protest At Church", "description": "If Minnesota churchgoers expected local prosecutors to protect them after anti-ICE disruptors halted a worship service on Sunday, they might want to think again: A top staffer for Hennepin County&#8217;s Soros-backed prosecutor was among the protesters.Jamael Lundy works as intergovernmental affairs coordinator for Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, is married to St. Paul City Council member Anika Bowie, and is running for a seat in the state legislature as a Democrat, according to his campaign website.The Department of Justice is pursuing federal charges against protesters who disrupted a church service, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon has said. In his role in Moriarty&#8217;s office, Lundy is the very staffer who would interface with the federal government, including on an existing investigation into Moriarty boasting that she takes into account a suspect&#8217;s &#8220;racial identity&#8221; when making charging decisions.Lundy was interviewed by Don Lemon as a group of protesters gathered, holding an upside-down American flag, to plan the takeover of the worship service — inadvertently undermining the point that Lemon was trying to make, which was that the protests were not backed by local officials.&#8220;People are fighting back and organizing, in large part without support from officials, local officials. There are some people who want to be involved, local officials, but they&#8217;re doing this all on their own, this is all grassroots,&#8221; Lemon said. Pulling a member of the crowd out at random, he asked: &#8220;Without giving out what the operation is, why are you out here?&#8221;The man turned out to be Lundy, who answered: &#8220;I&#8217;m here to support our community activists. I&#8217;m currently a candidate for Minnesota State Senate District 65. I feel like it&#8217;s important if you&#8217;re going to be representing people in office, that you&#8217;re out here with the people as well.&#8221;Lemon seemed to ignore what he had said and re-emphasized the opposite point, saying, &#8220;The people are organizing on their own, even without representatives or officials, and hoping that everyone gets involved. This is grassroots.&#8221;Lundy replied: &#8220;We all we got. I&#8217;m actually married to an elected official; I work closely with elected officials, but direct action from the community, certainly within the lines of the law, is so important to show that we have one voice.&#8221;Protesters then stormed the church, leaving people fleeing, with some falling on ice as they raced for the exits. Protesters said they aimed to end the church service, and harangue parishioners, because they believed that a pastor at the church also worked for ICE.Inside the church, a man who appears to be Lundy can be seen raising his fist and chanting the name of the pastor followed by &#8220;OUT, OUT,&#8221; as well as, &#8220;Who shut this down? We shut this down.&#8221;One protester said, &#8220;This ain&#8217;t God&#8217;s house, it&#8217;s the house of the devil.&#8221; Lemon celebrated, saying, &#8220;You have to make people uncomfortable in these times. You have to be willing to go into places and make people uncomfortable, that is what this country is about.&#8221;Lemon then interviewed a pastor, who said, &#8220;Our church had gathered for worship, which we do every Sunday, and we were interrupted by this group of protesters. We asked them to leave, and obviously they have not left. This is unacceptable, it&#8217;s shameful to interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship.&#8221;Lundy&#8217;s campaign website says that he previously worked for Minnesota House Rep. Carlos Mariani, the Democrat House Caucus Campaign, Congresswoman Betty McCullum, and the state teachers union.Lundy also founded &#8220;Black Operations Public Relations LLC,&#8221; and runs a company called &#8220;Homes for Homies Property Management LLC,&#8221; &#8220;providing affordable housing for those struggling with credit and criminal backgrounds.&#8221;The Homes for Homies website says: &#8220;He founded this company with the vision of improving housing access to all, but specifically to those with low income, criminal backgrounds, and people of color. Since it’s [sic] founding, home for homies [sic] has grown from a property management company with a goal of removing barriers to housing to a real estate development company centered around expanding housing affordability through expanding housing supply. As Home for Homies continues to expand, its founding values of making profit through making a difference remains [sic].&#8221;On Facebook, he suggests that his &#8220;profit&#8221; comes from federal Section 8 funds and implies that he would rent homes to illegal immigrants, writing: &#8220;It&#8217;s become increasingly apparent how much folks are hurting from the economic impact of the lawless federal occupation of the Twin Cities and as a result, I&#8217;m seeing the longest vacancy in my tenure as a landlord. For that reason, I am intentionally reducing the price by $300 a month for this 3/4 bedroom listing on the East Side of Saint Paul, far below the normal price I set based off of section 8 guidance. So if your [sic] looking for a deeply affordable 3-4 bedroom unit, without credit or criminal background barriers, open to all residents of all statuses, please contact me via DM.&#8221;The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is investigating Minneapolis for potentially discriminating by steering federal housing subsidies to &#8220;people of color, Indigenous people, and/or immigrant communities.&#8221;The Daily Wire has reached out to Lundy, Moriarty, and Dhillon.", "publish_date": "2026-01-20", "url": "https://www.dailywire.com/news/minneapolis-prosecutors-aide-spouse-of-city-council-member-disrupted-church-service-in-ice-protest", "my_topic": "minneapolis-ice"}

{"media_url": "dailywire.com", "title": "A Day In The Life Of Minneapolis ICE Agents", "description": "If you think you understand what an ICE officer faces on the ground in Minneapolis, you’re wrong.We spent the day with ICE officers in Minneapolis, where agents have been under siege for weeks. It was constant chaos.Anti-ICE agitators in the Twin Cities have grown increasingly brazen since the death of Renee Good, a protester who was fatally shot by an ICE officer after apparently striking an agent with her car, causing him to bleed internally.These protests have not distracted ICE from its mission, which has so far led to the arrest of roughly 10,000 illegal immigrants in Minnesota.&#8220;It&#8217;s not deterring us, we&#8217;re still doing [arrests],&#8221; Samuel Olsen, the director of the agency&#8217;s St. Paul office, told The Daily Wire. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had to just adjust and ensure that we have enough people out.&#8221;ICE&#8217;s targets that afternoon included illegal immigrants with drug convictions, assault charges, and convictions for driving while impaired. Some of the targets were released by local authorities who ignored ICE&#8217;s requests to hand them over to federal custody.As we departed the ICE office, a &#8220;spotter&#8221; watched on a nearby street corner as he notified a &#8220;network of people that are throughout the city,&#8221; Olsen said. The first target was quickly &#8220;blown&#8221; after outsiders spotted ICE, making it difficult to catch the illegal immigrant in his element, a local restaurant in St. Paul. It was the second time officers tried to catch him after their cover was blown.Still, Olsen said they wouldn&#8217;t give up on him.&#8220;It looks like there&#8217;s people almost everywhere looking for our vehicles, and we were spotted in the lot,&#8221; Olsen said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to probably move to the next target and then just kind of keep this one still.&#8221;It was then on to the next arrest, but it wasn&#8217;t long after we headed that way that anti-ICE protesters began following close behind as they communicated with each other on radios.As we neared the target&#8217;s apartment, dozens of protesters had amassed on nearly every corner. They gathered by the convoy of officers as they blew whistles and honked their horns to alert the neighborhood that ICE was there. Even a school bus driver passing by was blowing a whistle.The officers decided they wouldn&#8217;t be stopped and walked in to knock on their target&#8217;s door, hoping to make a peaceful arrest.All the while, anti-ICE activists screamed nonstop insults like &#8220;coward&#8221; and &#8220;no one wants you here&#8221; at the officers.Still, the officers pushed through, but were unsuccessful in getting the target to answer the door. They couldn&#8217;t take any additional action because they didn&#8217;t have a judicial warrant.As the officers tried to leave the area, several anti-ICE agitators blocked them in with their cars. The situation soon grew tense as one of the officers got out and shouted orders at the agitators to move their cars back.&#8220;We&#8217;re blocked,&#8221; an officer said on the radio.&#8220;This is bad back here guys,&#8221; another could be heard on the radio. &#8220;We&#8217;re surrounded back here.&#8221;Amid the melee, one of the drivers, who was in a Tesla, hit one of the ICE officers&#8217; cars before zooming off erratically. He later continued to follow the officers before he rolled down his window and shouted, &#8220;I&#8217;m illegal, come and get me.&#8221;Assaults on ICE officers have become all too normal, surging more than 1,000%, while death threats against them have increased more than 8,000%.In Minneapolis, protesters are showing up at nearly every raid.Before, &#8220;it was very rare &#8230; now, we&#8217;re making arrests of agitators daily,&#8221; Olsen said.&#8220;When we have to arrest a U.S. citizen, it really takes us away from our other mission.&#8221;", "publish_date": "2026-01-20", "url": "https://www.dailywire.com/news/a-day-in-the-life-of-minneapolis-ice-agents", "my_topic": "minneapolis-ice"}

{"media_url": "dailywire.com", "title": "U.S. Attorney Who Led Prosecution Of Sprawling Minnesota Fraud Ring Abruptly Resigns", "description": "The federal prosecutor at the center of Minnesota&#8217;s massive welfare fraud investigation resigned on Tuesday as the Trump administration ramps up its broader push to uncover additional fraud in the state.Joseph Thompson announced his resignation in an email without providing a reason for his abrupt departure, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. Thompson was the second-in-command at the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Minnesota and made a name for himself as the lead prosecutor in the Feeding Our Future fraud case, which resulted in more than 50 guilty pleas and seven convictions. He was appointed by President Donald Trump last May to serve as acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota until Daniel Rosen assumed the top position in October.“It has been an honor and a privilege to represent the United States and this office,” Thompson wrote in his email.Two other prosecutors from the Minnesota U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office also announced their resignations on Tuesday. Assistant U.S. Attorney Harry Jacobs, who also prosecuted the Feeding Our Future case, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Melinda Williams will also be leaving their posts.Thompson&#8217;s resignation comes as he is being floated as a candidate for the Justice Department&#8217;s new assistant attorney general position, which will focus on combating fraud. The new role was announced by Vice President JD Vance last week, and Vance said that the position&#8217;s &#8220;efforts will start and focus primarily in Minnesota.&#8221;It&#8217;s unclear if Thompson&#8217;s resignation is related to his potential candidacy for the new DOJ position. The New York Times reported that &#8220;people with knowledge&#8221; of the situation said Thompson&#8217;s resignation is over disagreements with the Justice Department&#8217;s push to investigate the wife of Renee Good, the Minneapolis woman fatally shot by a federal agent last week. Thompson opposed the Justice Department&#8217;s strategy as well as its decision to shut out state authorities from the shooting investigation, according to the Times.The Justice Department did not say whether Thompson&#8217;s resignation was related to the shooting investigation. A DOJ official told The Daily, “As with any officer-involved shooting, each law enforcement agency has an internal investigation protocol, including DHS. As such, ICE [Office of Professional Responsibility] has its own investigation underway. This runs parallel to any FBI investigation.&#8221;Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O&#8217;Hara argued that the timing of Thompson&#8217;s resignation raises questions about the Trump administration&#8217;s justification for surging federal law enforcement and immigration agents in Minnesota.“When you lose the leader responsible for making the fraud cases, it tells you this [immigration enforcement] isn’t really about prosecuting fraud,” O’Hara said.Thompson&#8217;s work uncovering the massive Feeding Our Future fraud scheme threw Minnesota into the spotlight before more allegations of fraud involving Minneapolis&#8217;s large Somali population got the attention of the White House. Most of those implicated in the Feeding Our Future fraud case were of Somali descent, and now, the Trump administration is looking into claims of fraud being committed at Somali-run businesses and daycares, while swaths of immigration enforcement agents have been deployed to the Twin Cities.", "publish_date": "2026-01-13", "url": "https://www.dailywire.com/news/u-s-attorney-who-led-prosecution-of-sprawling-minnesota-fraud-ring-abruptly-resigns", "my_topic": "minneapolis-ice"}

Since September, the administration has killed at least 115 people in 30 boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific.These military actions in the region are raising questions about the nature of U.S. intervention abroad. Last week, the Senate advanced a measure limiting Trump’s power to take further military action in Venezuela.Now, the president is threatening intervention in Iran amid crackdowns on protests across the country. And here in the U.S., federal agents shot three civilians last week, injuring a man and woman in Portland and killing a woman in Minneapolis.What does President Trump’s military intervention abroad mean for issues at home?

Brittany and Abené unpack the importance of this moment, how Good's death compares to other deaths at the hands of the federal government, and how the narrative around her death is already messier than it should be.Support Public Media.

{"media_url": "dailywire.com", "title": "White House Stands By Embattled ICE Agent, Slams Renee Good As ‘Lunatic’", "description": "WASHINGTON—The ICE agent who fatally shot Renee Good after she blocked federal officers with her car and then drove toward him with her vehicle has the staunch backing of the White House, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Monday.Leavitt reiterated President Donald Trump&#8217;s position on the incident as she spoke to reporters outside the White House on a frigid Monday afternoon, tearing into protestors for opposing the ICE operations in Minneapolis — operations intended to make their community safer.&#8220;All weekend long, you had agitators and violent American citizens out in the streets of Minneapolis &#8216;protesting,'&#8221; Leavitt said. &#8220;Protesting what, exactly? Apparently, they are protesting the removal of heinous murderers and rapists and criminals.&#8221;The White House press secretary praised the ICE agents who continue doing their work despite the backlash from left-wing protestors. She specifically emphasized that the Trump administration has the back of the ICE agent who shot 37-year-old Good, described by her neighbors as a &#8220;warrior&#8221; member of an &#8220;ICE watch&#8221; group.&#8220;ICE is doing an incredibly important job that&#8217;s not just important to our homeland security, but our national security,&#8221; Leavitt said. &#8220;This administration will continue to stand wholeheartedly by the brave men and women of ICE, including that officer in Minneapolis who was absolutely justified in using self-defense against a lunatic who is part of a group, an organized group, to interject and to impede on law enforcement operations.&#8221;WASHINGTON, DC &#8211; JANUARY 12: U.S. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks to reporters outside of the West Wing of the White House on January 12, 2026, in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)She added, &#8220;It&#8217;s disgusting what we have seen from the Left, and I think that it just shows you where the modern-day Democrat Party stands today in protecting illegal alien pedophiles and rapists and murderers over law-abiding American citizens and our brave men and women who serve in law enforcement.&#8221;The ICE agent who is currently under heavy scrutiny was previously dragged over 100 yards down the street as he chased an illegal immigrant who was convicted of “repeatedly sexually abusing his 16-year-old stepdaughter,” the Daily Wire&#8217;s Jennie Taer previously reported. The officer repeatedly tried to de-escalate the situation and gave the suspect the opportunity to comply, court documents show.According to the Department of Homeland Security, there has been a 1,300% increase in assaults on ICE agents, a 3,200% surge in vehicle attacks on ICE agents, and an 8,000% increase in death threats against ICE agents. DHS blames this rise in violence against ICE agents on the “malicious rhetoric of sanctuary politicians.&#8221;Democrats across the board argue that the ICE agent killed Good without justification. Top voices like Zohran Mamdani outright accused the ICE agent of murdering Good, former presidential candidate Kamala Harris said the &#8220;Trump administration&#8217;s explanation of this shooting is pure gaslighting,&#8221; and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has repeatedly characterized ICE and their activities as dangerous to the public, telling ICE to &#8220;get the f*ck out of Minneapolis.&#8221;Meanwhile, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance were quick to back the agent, citing videos of the incident showing that he shot Good after she drove her car into him.&#8220;I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota,&#8221; the president said in a post on Wednesday. &#8220;It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.&#8221;Trump said at the time that &#8220;the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.&#8221;&#8220;They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!&#8221;As for Vance, the vice president took the podium at the White House press briefing on Thursday and aggressively defended the administration&#8217;s immigration enforcement, backing the ICE agent and calling on reporters to pray for the man facing so much backlash, arguing that the agent “wishes he was not put in the position where he had to fire a gun to defend his own life.”&#8220;The way that the media, by and large, has reported this story has been an absolute disgrace,&#8221; he told the White House press, &#8220;and it puts our law enforcement officers at risk every single day.&#8221;", "publish_date": "2026-01-12", "url": "https://www.dailywire.com/news/white-house-stands-by-embattled-ice-agent-slams-renee-good-as-lunatic", "my_topic": "minneapolis-ice"}

Authorities claim the woman attacked officers while they were digging their car out of the snow, but video from the scene and the municipal officials heavily dispute that claim.This week GOP lawmakers from Minnesota testified at a hastily-scheduled House Oversight Committee hearing about welfare fraud scandal allegations in their state. And on Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services froze $10 billion in five states including Minnesota, New York, California, Illinois and Colorado. That funding covers childcare subsidies, cash support for low-income families, and other social services.Meanwhile, its been nearly one week since Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were captured by U.S. forces and brought to face charges of narco-terrorism on American soil.And the Trump administration’s actions in Venezuela are having ripple effects across the globe. Europe is on edge as the U.S president this week suggested the territory could be in his crosshairs next, raising questions about America’s relationship with NATO.Also this week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending U.S. support for global 66 organizations, agencies, and commissions, following his administration’s review of participation in and funding for all international organizations.Find more of our programs online.

{"media_url": "dailywire.com", "title": "Illegal Immigrants Caught Hauling 300 Pounds Of Cocaine In Semi-Truck", "description": "Two illegal immigrant truckers from India were arrested Saturday for allegedly hauling 309 pounds of cocaine inside a semi-truck they were driving through Putnam County, Indiana, The Daily Wire has learned.Gurpreet Singh, 25, and Jasveer Singh, 30, were driving from Joplin, Missouri, when they were pulled over by Indiana State Troopers, who observed that their truck was drifting, according to FOX59. The troopers brought in a drug-sniffing K9, who helped them locate 140-kilogram packages containing approximately 309 pounds of cocaine that were concealed in the truck&#8217;s sleeper berth.The cache of drugs is worth an estimated $7 million, according to reports.During the traffic stop, the illegal immigrant pair presented the troopers with their California-issued commercial driver&#8217;s licenses.In a statement shared with The Daily Wire, the Department of Homeland Security blamed Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom for the alleged drug smuggling attempt.“Thanks to Gavin Newsom’s reckless policies, these two criminal illegal aliens were granted commercial licenses by the state of California and were arrested for trafficking a whopping 300 pounds of cocaine inside a semi-truck,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement shared with The Daily Wire.Christmas Sale – Get 40% off New DailyWire+ Annual Memberships“Gavin Newsom and his fellow sanctuary politicians even refused to honor an arrest detainer on one of these criminal illegal aliens in December. Sanctuary policies put American lives at risk. ICE law enforcement lodged arrest detainers to ensure these drug traffickers are not allowed back into American communities,&#8221; she said.Gurpreet Singh crossed the southern border illegally on March 11, 2023, near Lukeville, Arizona, and was released into the country under the Biden administration, DHS told The Daily Wire.Jasveer Singh crossed the border illegally on March 21, 2017, near Otay Mesa, California. He was arrested in December 2025 in San Bernardino for allegedly receiving stolen property, but was released after sanctuary authorities in California refused to honor a federal immigration detainer.Immigration and Customs Enforcement has since filed detainers with local authorities to ensure that they&#8217;re handed over for deportation rather than eventually released onto the streets after their latest alleged crimes, according to DHS.During his latest encounter with police, Jasveer said he was employed as a truck driver, but that he hitched a ride with a different carrier for the latest trip, according to FOX59. He said he was instructed to haul an empty tractor-trailer to an Indian restaurant near Richmond, Indiana, to eat food and wait for his cargo load to arrive.Meanwhile, Gurpreet said he hitched a ride from California to Joplin in a different truck before he met up with Jasveer as they headed to the same Indian restaurant, the outlet reported.Jasveer also said that the truck lacked the required Electronic Logging Device that ensures drivers aren&#8217;t on the roads for longer than what is considered safe, according to FOX59.The Trump administration has heavily scrutinized Newsom as it investigates the issuance of commercial driver&#8217;s licenses across the country to illegal immigrants following a string of fatal collisions.California recently announced that it would delay its effort to cancel thousands of commercial driver&#8217;s licenses issued to foreign drivers.The Trump administration instructed California to get it done by Jan. 5, threatening to withhold $160 million in federal funding if the state failed to make the deadline.Newsom responded, saying their delay was a result of &#8220;federal mismanagement.&#8221;&#8220;YOUR staff told CA DMV they were open to an extension 8 days ago. In fact, FMCSA agreed an extension made logistical sense and was reasonable (in a meeting on Dec. 18)! DMV relied on that guidance and acted accordingly,&#8221; Newsom wrote in a Dec. 31 X post.&#8220;Only after the plan became public did your agency suddenly object,&#8221; he wrote.", "publish_date": "2026-01-05", "url": "https://www.dailywire.com/news/illegal-immigrants-caught-hauling-300-pounds-of-cocaine-in-semi-truck-dhs-says", "my_topic": "minneapolis-ice"}
